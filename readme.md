# Final Project

## 6 issues resolved.

### 1. Editing produciton.yml file.
Production.yml file had issues that were causing the github actions to fail. I changed github username an d docker image name. I added GITHUB_USERNAME and GITHUB_TOKEN that helped in resolving the issues successfully.

### 2. Emain verification issue
The user verification structure was not in order. So, I had to change order of few lines of code and added few test cases to check if the emain verification was working well or not.
